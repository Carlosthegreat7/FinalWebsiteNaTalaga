            <p>Hi! I am Carl and I am currently studying at NU Fairview. My course is BSIT-MI. My interests include driving, playing online games, and cooking. I am a huge Star Wars fan as i have been watching it since i was a little boy. I also love cars and aim to have a Nissan GT-R 2016 model in the near future.I have proper knowledge in certain programming languages such as Java, Python, and Javascript. I am also moderately efficient in using Microsoft Office apps.</p>

            <h3> Carl's Thoughts on this article</h3> 

            <br>
            <br>
            <p> <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/10/ai-impacting-jobs-could-lead-to-higher-salaries-top-talent-ceo-says.html" target ="_blank"> Is AI impacting your job? Your salary might actually rise, top talent CEO says</a></p>
            <br>

            <p> I think that this article is very informative and helpful to those who are new to the field of programming. It gives a lot of insight on what to expect when you are a programmer. It also gives a lot of tips on how to be a better programmer. I think about this as the next step to evolution for humans. With AI becoming more mainstream nowadays, people should take it seriously and adapt on the changes or it will greatly impact their livelihood. AI as a tool to be embraced rather than feared, leveraging its capabilities to drive innovation and create new opportunities. However, it's essential to acknowledge that while AI can perform certain tasks efficiently, it lacks the nuanced reasoning and creativity inherent in human cognition. rather than viewing AI as a replacement for human intellect, we should see it as a complementary tool that can improve our capabilities when used properly. </p>
